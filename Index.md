The Chosen [www.thechosen.tv](https://www.thechosen.tv) is a historical drama which was first released in 2017 and is now in Season 5 of the series. 

As is with many cases, media can have a strong influence in our understanding and even beliefs. Wether that be Charlton Heston gaining stardom in Moses in 1956 and how we may relate to the character and storyline or a recent interpretation of Noah by Russel Crowe. 

The purpose of this project is to help us manage that and the initial and over-arching objectives are the following:

## Overarching Objectives
